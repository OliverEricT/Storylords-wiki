== Be Careful What You Fish For ==

[[daranos:characters:billbertdinglesmith|Billbert Dinglesmith]] is fishing one morning when he catches [[daranos:characters:laguna|Laguna]] the mermaid on his line. Laguna offers Billbert a singular wish, which he promptly throws away by wishing for something stupid. The something stupid in this case being an infinitely refillable plate of fish (ding) and chips (ding). Billbert's wife, [[daranos:characters:milly|Milly]], loves fish and chips, and today was her birthday. Before heading home, he stopped off at a local tavern, [[daranos:locations:thetittytwister|The Titty Twister]].
Once there, all the edible items start turning into steak fries. This causes a brawl to breakout, and Billbert quickly flees home. Once home his wife promises him birthday sex, however the sex is interrupted by steak fries.
