==== Laguna ====

The biggest tittied mermaid you will ever meet in your life. Known to give those who catch her a singular wish. She is also a part time lifguard. Due to the nature of wishes; the bigger they are the easier they are for Laguna to handle... Just like your momma last night.

When [[daranos:characters:billbertdinglesmith|billbert]] caught her in the lake, she offered Billbert a wish. Billbert asked for a plate of fish and chips. This being a particularly small wish, made it very difficult for Laguna to grant it properly. This led to many shenanigans for Billbert.
